# Data Exploration in SQL


The Adventure Works dataset was obtainedfrom the official Microsoft site and imported it to the Microsoft SQL server to study the nature and characteristics of the different variables in different tables. The tables are primarily categorized under four categories: Human resources, personal, production, purchases, and sales. 

After a careful study of these variables, I set up SQL queries to filter out the information that we need to answer the six main business problems as follows:

1. What is the regional sales in the best-performing country?
2. Identify the three most important cities. Show the breakdown of top-level product categories against the cities.
3. What is the relationship between Country and Revenue?
4. What is the relationship between sick leave and Job Title?
5. What is the relationship between store trading duration and revenue?
6. What is the relationship between the size of the stores, number of employees and revenue?
